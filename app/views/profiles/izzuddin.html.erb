          <p style="text-align:center; margin-top:10px;">when I came out of the primary school SMKBTHO, I came out of my "dark age". A period where I was once bullied by someone I don't remember anymore and sidelined by the in-crowd.When I was a kid I knew right away I'm an introvert, as I dont really talk with others.But it's hurting; in a way that I don't really make many friends. Life was tough back then. Waking up early morning, finishing homework, tuition class..etc. It was like living in black and white.</p>

            The reason why I looked very "arrogant" at that time? 2003 was a pretty terrible year for me. my parents expect me to get straight A in UPSR, but I got B in english. And they were pretty upset with it , and I felt very terrible becasue I let them down. And that is the reason why I was super-serious in SMKBTHO2. Everything that I did  back then was only for one reason; to get straight A in PMR. Revenge of the Sith, as the called it. Then hell I did it. Life after school was rather challenging; SBP, mechanical engineering, studied in Japan, make new friends...I enjoyed and savoured every phase and every moment since then. </p>

              Now I worked as a programmer; web development and creating app for iOS. Sometimes when working I recalled myself that period  when I was in the school. I remembered those good old times; playing playstation at Zul's house, create a project to build remote control aeroplane,marathon, played the sims, hari kantin..watched Harry Potter, etc...man,, good old times indeed. </p>
